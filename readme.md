# Color quest

A fun widget to learn more about:
* adding elements to the DOM,
* and filtering data.

If the basics are working you can add an option to add & filter on different shapes as well - circles & triangles are support in the style sheet as well.

You can see it online at: https://codex-academy.github.io/color-quest/

## Change the widget

You need to change the widget to be able to:

* add a square with the selected color & number,
* if no number or color is selected nothing should be added (display message),
* a color & number combination is unique - it can only be added once,
* filter for a selected color or number,
* or filter for a selected color & number.

Be sure to test your application logic.
